# NLP Sentiment Analysis On Tweets For Stock News Prediction

In this project, trained a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model to perform stocks sentiment analysis. Seaborn and matplotlib libraries of python were used for Data Visualization.Natural language processing toolkit for python was used for:
i) Basic Data Analysis, processing text data, and plotting Word Cloud
ii) Transforming the Dataset : Converting words (text) into numbers.
iii) Tokenizing, Lemmatizing and Padding the training and test dataset
The transformed dataset was then used to train a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM) to make predictions. The deep learning model analyzed thousands of Twitter tweets to predict peopleâ€™s sentiment towards a particular company or stock. The model can have a lot of applications to understand the sentiment from public tweets, which could then be used to make strong decisons on buying and sellling of stocks/securities/cryptocurrencies.
The results of the model came out to be:
1) Training Data (Accuracy) : 94.82%
2) F1 Score : 81.53%
3) Recall Score : 87.7%
4) Accuracy Score : 75.41%
